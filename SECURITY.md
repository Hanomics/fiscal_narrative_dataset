# Security Policy

While this repository contains primarily data and documentation, we
welcome reports of potential security vulnerabilities in our code or
documentation build scripts.

## Supported versions

The scripts in this repository are primarily used to validate data and
build the static documentation site.  We will address security issues in
the current branch of the repository.  Older releases are immutable and
will not be patched.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities by emailing
<security@example.com>.  We will acknowledge receipt of your report
within 72 hours and will endeavour to provide a timeline for a fix.

Please do not disclose details of the vulnerability publicly until we have
released a patch and updated this repository.
