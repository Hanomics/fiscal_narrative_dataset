# Roadmap

This document outlines planned additions and improvements to the Fiscal Consolidation SSA project.

## Country expansion

* **Short term (2026)** – Add narrative fiscal consolidation data for up to five additional Sub‑Saharan African countries based on source availability.
* **Medium term (2027–2028)** – Explore extending the coverage to North African countries and small island economies in the region.
* **Long term (2029+)** – Integrate the SSA data with global narrative fiscal consolidation datasets to facilitate cross‑region comparisons.

## Methodological enhancements

* Develop a standardized coding manual and training materials for contributors.
* Introduce a peer review process for new episode submissions (see `review_process.md`).
* Publish replication files and code used in the working paper.

## Documentation and tooling

* Build an interactive explorer on the GitHub Pages site to filter narrative excerpts by country and year.
* Automate the release process via GitHub Actions (validation and documentation build).
