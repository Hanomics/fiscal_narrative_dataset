# Working Paper

This folder is reserved for the working paper associated with the Fiscal Consolidation SSA dataset.  The working paper will describe the narrative identification methodology, present descriptive statistics, and discuss the economic implications of fiscal consolidations in the region.

At the moment this folder contains a placeholder.  When the working paper is ready for public dissemination, its source files (e.g. LaTeX or Quarto) and figures should be placed here.
