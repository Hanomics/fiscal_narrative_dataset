The maximum import duty was reduced from 110 percent to 35 percent and the number of tariff bands from 43 to 8, while export taxes were reduced to 1-2 percent. At the same time, the authorities have begun to strengthen tax administration, putting particular emphasis on reducing the large evasion of customs duties.”",

Its key components were: a strong fiscal adjustment; the adoption of a tighter monetary policy stance; and the reform of the foreign exchange auction system.

This contraction stemmed in particular from the elimination of the highest value-added tax (VAT) rate, the reduction of the normal VAT rate from 25 percent to 20 percent, and a global reform of the customs tariff that reduced the average import tax rate by about 5 percentage points. Total expenditure declined from 33.5 percent of GDP in 1993 to 31.1 percent of GDP in 1994, owing largely to a cut in primary expenditure from 23.7 percent of GDP to 21.7 percent. In particular, the wage bill was reduced by more than 3 percentage points of GDP to the equivalent of 8.7 percent of GDP in 1994, through limited wage increases and a 3 percent reduction in the size of the civil service.

The surplus would also finance, in part, the clearance of arrears to the World Bank (totaling 2.5 percent of GDP as of end June 2007) and the resumption of debt service payments to the AfDB. The planned fiscal adjustment, combined with repayment of domestic arrears, is expected to have little or no contractionary effect…Revenue is planned to rise by ½ percent of GDP through more efficient taxation of petroleum products, improvements in tax administration, and extension of tax collection to the whole country…2007 budget seeks to cut nonessential spending, contains a modest peace dividend, and provides for greater social and crisis-related spending (MEFP, 21-24).

Revenue collection improved as targeted. Tax revenue was slightly above target, but only because of recourse to advance tax payments (½ percent of GDP), mostly on cocoa export duties (at a 7 percent rebate), against the program undertaking. Non-tax revenue from the petroleum sector fell short. Overruns of 0.8 percent of GDP on current spending were at the expense of crisis-exit programs and investment. The overruns reflected unbudgeted discretionary spending by the presidency and prime minister’s office, military wages, frontline bonuses, and unforeseen housing allowances for primary school teachers. A large part of spending took place through treasury advances which made it harder to monitor budget execution. On the financing side, the deposit buildup of 1 percent of GDP for World Bank arrears clearance did not occur because the authorities, under pressure from the private sector (including private schools), accelerated repayment of domestic arrears (by 1.5 percent of GDP, compared to 0.5 percent of GDP under the program). This repayment was made possible by a large (though undersubscribed) issuance of two-year bills on the WAEMU market in September, raising the equivalent of 1.2 percent of GDP at 6½ percent interest. Overall, Côte d’Ivoire slightly improved its performance on the WAEMU convergence criteria.”",

These measures are focused on: (i) eliminating tax exemptions, particularly relating to VAT on non-staple food items and the investment code (end-September 2024 SB); (ii) undertaking important tax administration reforms relating to property taxes; (iii) increasing the registration rate for cacao; (iv) several tax administration enhancements to better manage tax collection, including relating to transfer pricing, tobacco traceability, and automated management of VAT deduction collected at customs (end-June 2024 SB). In addition to these measures, 0.1 percent of GDP increase in tax revenue is expected due to higher export tax revenue from improved terms of trade.”",

The report states on the same page “Boosting spending efficiency and rationalizing nonpriority spending will support the fiscal consolidation. Expenditure in the 2024 budget is 1.1 percent of GDP lower than 2023, mainly as a result of curbs on nominal spending growth, with a 1.4 percent of GDP fall in current expenditure offset by a 0.3 percent increase in capital expenditure. Spending curbs largely reflect the continued unwinding of COVID-19 era spending, and of food and fuel subsidies associated with the policy response to the war in Ukraine. In addition, while wages are increasing in nominal terms, the wage bill is being curtailed by 0.2 percent of GDP after increases in public workers’ benefits during the last two years, and in line with the government’s objective of containing the wage bill by hiring one new public servant for every two retirees (except for health and education). The increase in capital spending accounts for critical investment needs in infrastructure, education, health, and security, including in northern border areas receiving refugees.”",

The authorities are committed to pursuing a growth-friendly fiscal consolidation over the medium-term to ensure fiscal sustainability. Their goal is to achieve the regional overall fiscal deficit convergence criterion of 1.6 percent of GDP by 2024. In the same consolidation efforts, they intend to reach a non oil primary balance—key fiscal anchor—of 2 percent of non-oil GDP by 2024 against 4.9 percent prior to the crisis (2019) and 4 percent in 2021. To this end, the authorities are placing a particular emphasis on stepping up the mobilization of non-oil domestic revenues and rationalizing expenditures while protecting priority social spending and improving public spending efficiency. On the revenue side, the 2022 budget law sets a target for additional mobilization of non-oil revenues up to 0.8 percent of GDP and introduces measures to increase tax revenue and streamline parafiscal taxation.”",

Additional efforts will come from further expenditure rationalization, including on the subsidies and transfers (around 1.1 percent of GDP) and stronger non-oil revenue mobilization (around 0.3 percent of GDP) due to envisaged measures discussed in ¶24 (Text Table 2).”. The same report notes on page 43: “Fiscal policy in 2024 will remain focused on fiscal consolidation, and its effective implementation will depend on the formulation of a realistic budget. Budget revenues are expected to decline relative to GDP due to lower oil-related budget revenues, reflecting lower international oil prices, while efforts to mobilize non-oil domestic revenues (0.3 percent of GDP) will help offset this decline. However, lower projected international oil prices will also reduce fuel subsidy expenditures, opening up fiscal space for other expenditures, especially public investment.

However, exceptional security-related expenditures—projected to reach 2 percent of GDP in 2024—continue to strain public finances. In the first nine months of 2024, the authorities successfully contained non-security spending, which helped ease inflationary pressures and stabilize the currency. More recently, however, they approved public sector wage increases, largely for teachers, and regularized recruitments made in earlier years, adding an estimated 0.5 percentage points of GDP to the wage bill in 2024.

Revenue performance (including grants) was stable in 2018/19: the government was able to meet 93 percent of its tax collection target and overall general government revenues increased slightly to 3.2 percent of GDP. While import duties and indirect taxes underperformed, direct taxes were slightly above budget. On the expenditure front, the tighter fiscal stance was driven by a contraction of other recurrent expenditures by 0.3 percent of GDP, largely realized through targeted cost saving interventions introduced by the MoF in the form of optimizing administrative and travel costs as well as spending on goods and services by federal Ministries.”",

This increase helps offset both a decline of grants (by about ½ percent of GDP), and a reduction of corporate income taxes (to spur investment) and an increase in the personal income tax threshold (to help reduce the tax burden facing low-income earners). Total expenditure will decline by 1½ percentage points of GDP to below 32 percent, mainly on account of lower domestic debt service and outlays for goods and services, and the elimination of TOR subsidies. These expenditure cuts amount to about 2¾ percentage points of GDP, and more than offset a slight increase in capital and poverty-related spending, and measures to cushion the impact of the higher petroleum prices on vulnerable households. The latter includes increased grants for education and health services, expanded rural electrification, and extended public transportation to less developed areas.”",

Calculations for the cyclically-adjusted primary balance based on WEO data point to fiscal consolidation efforts in 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2004 \\citep{Davidetal.2023}, yet no evidence of narrative fiscal actions is found for those years. IMF Country Report No. 03/200 (Table 25, p. 47) records declines in tax revenue of 1 percent of GDP between 1997/98 and 1998/99, 1.3 percent in 1999/00, 0.5 percent in 2000/01, and 2.2 percent in 2001/02, while non-tax revenue rose by 0.6 percent of GDP in 1998/99 and 1.2 percent in 2001/02. Although expenditure and net lending fell as a share of GDP during this period (Table 24, p. 46), the evidence indicates that the drop in spending, and the resulting improvement in the CAPB, was driven by factors unrelated to deliberate fiscal consolidation. As IMF Country Report No. 02/85 explains (p. 3): \"The government's fiscal program went off track over the course of 2000/01. A sizable loss of foreign program financing and the failure to privatize Kenya Telkom severely limited cash expenditure, while the overall deficit exceeded the (adjusted) program deficit by 1 percent of GDP. Recourse to arrears accumulation and a lack of finance to unwind stalled projects has also brought about an escalation of new claims of pending bills on the budget. This is a serious problem that needs to be addressed urgently.\" The same report adds (p. 9): \"The fiscal program went off track over the course of 2000/01, While the after-grants overall cash deficit was limited to 1.8 percent of GDP, government expenditure commitments could not be kept within the constraints imposed by the sizable loss of foreign program finance and the failure to privatize Kenya Telkorn. The lower-than-programmed interest cost could only partially mitigate the pressure on the budget as primary expenditure (excluding drought-related expenditure) remained at the originally programmed level, resulting in a before-grants overall commitment deficit of 5 percent of GDP in 2000/01.\" Moreover, there is no evidence that a genuine fiscal consolidation was successfully implemented in 1998/1999, or that the fiscal measures adopted were independent of prevailing economic conditions. IMF Country Report No. 08/338 (p. 19) notes: \"Fiscal slippages took place ahead of the 1997 elections, including sharp wage hikes and weak enforcement of spending controls. A short SMP was agreed in 1998 and helped restore prudent policies, but efforts to bring the governance agenda back on-track failed. The ESAF arrangement expired in April 1999.\". The same report further states (p. 29): \"Fiscal targets under the first three arrangements aimed to limit demand pressures. Overall deficit targets (with limits on CBK financing) became increasingly tight during the 1990s, and although they were often missed, outcomes increasingly reflected tighter execution. The tightening may have continued for too long, however, given slowing growth. During 2000/01–2002/03, deficit targets were relaxed in anticipation of large donor inflows and may have become too loose, as domestic debt increased when aid did not materialize (see chart).\"}",

Calculations of the cyclically-adjusted primary balance based on WEO data point to fiscal consolidation efforts in 2006 and 2016 \\citep{Davidetal.2023}. Yet, no evidence of narrative fiscal actions is found for those years. Further investigation indicates that the fiscal position was expected to deteriorate in 2005/06, with no genuine consolidation taking place. As highlighted in Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 06/01 (January 3, 2006): \"The slowdown of economic activity and the suspension of periodic adjustments of retail petroleum prices have negatively affected Mauritius' fiscal position. While the central government deficit was kept at about 5 percent of GDP during 2004/05, the State Trading Company (STC) incurred a rising deficit owing to the lack of adjustment of retail petroleum prices since early 2005. Unless corrective action is taken, the overall fiscal position during 2005/06 is expected to deteriorate further, owing to lower than originally projected revenue collections associated with lackluster activity and a further increase of the STC's deficit as the gap between retail prices and import costs of petroleum products widens...Directors urged the authorities to take steps to stem a further deterioration of the fiscal position in 2005/06.\" Similarly, the apparent improvement in the CAPB in 2016 most likely reflects stronger economic growth and higher non-tax revenue, rather than a deliberate fiscal consolidation. The Economist Intelligence Unit report of November 6, 2015 (p. 5) notes: \"The fiscal year 2015/16 (July-June) budget projects that revenue will grow by 14\\% in nominal terms compared with the 2014 outcome...However, the budget includes no new tax measures. Indeed, the finance minister, Seetanah Lutchmeenaraidoo, referred to it as a \"no-tax budget\". The revenue projection is based on the economy growing by 5.3\\%, thus increasing the tax collection volume...Expenditure will grow in light of announced measures to boost social spending, particularly on health and education.\"}",

Collection of most taxes turned out lower than envisaged. The authorities attributed the revenue shortfall mainly to higher-than projected value-added tax (VAT) reimbursements related to megaprojects, delays incurred by corporations in complying with the payments calendar under the new corporate income tax code, and the impact of the appreciation of the metical. Another important factor was the weakening of tax collection during the transition period leading to the nomination of a new government. The revenue shortfall was partially offset by cuts in current expenditures affecting negatively the composition of total expenditure. As a result, the share of priority expenditures to total expenditure (about 63 percent) was slightly lower than programmed. The domestic primary deficit fell short of the program target by 0.7 of GDP, and the overall fiscal deficit, after grants, was slightly higher than envisaged (using the new GDP series).”",

The 2007 budget envisages a scaling-up of foreign aid and an associated increase in spending focused towards achieving the PARPA II targets (Table 2). Despite a nearly 0.2 percent of GDP revenue loss related to tariff reform, total domestic revenue is envisaged to rise by about 0.5 percent of GDP through: (i) a rationalization of unwarranted tax exemptions (e.g., VAT, and interest income on treasury bills); (ii) collection of new tax arrears amounting to about 0.2 percent of GDP; (iii) the resumption of quarterly updating of the specific fuel tax rate including recovering the real reduction due to non-indexation in 20058; (iv) higher non-tax revenues related to buoyant commodity prices; (v) and a continued improvement in tax administration in line with recent Technical Assistance (TA) from the Fund (MEFP, paragraph 15). Priority public investments will increase significantly. Most of these expenditures will be financed by foreign grants, and will be accompanied by sufficient counterpart funds and current spending for maintenance and operations (Table 6). The wage bill will increase to 7.5 per cent of GDP as envisaged in the CFMP, including a hiring of about 10,000 teachers and 3,000 health workers in line with their sectoral strategies. Transfer payments in 2007 are higher due to pension payments and the on-going gradual decentralization of spending. If a revenue shortfall materializes, the authorities have agreed to cut non-priority expenditures to meet the NCG target. Overall, the scaling-up of program aid will permit a higher domestic primary deficit with no recourse to domestic financing, allowing for a healthy increase in credit to the economy.”",

PARPA II emphasizes the importance of consolidating macroeconomic stability through prudent monetary and fiscal policies in the context of a flexible exchange rate regime. Central to this strategy will be a gradual strengthening of the fiscal position underpinned by an average increase in revenue of 0.5 percent of GDP per annum. Economic growth is expected to remain pro-poor and at about 7 percent per annum, while inflation is controlled to single digits through monetary control. The staffs welcome the well-presented macroeconomic framework in PARPA II. Now that the post-conflict agricultural rebound has largely run its course and first generation reforms are completed, there is a need for a second wave of reforms to sustain rapid growth. PARPA II could have, thus, benefited from a more developed analysis of the sources of growth and means to sustain productivity growth.”",

Fiscal restraint started in 2023Q1 and continued through 2023Q3, reducing domestic primary expenditure by 43 percent, on average, compared to 2022Q4. This reflects measures to rationalize wage bill spending, and lower spending on goods, services, transfers, subsidies, and capital. Amid a significant increase in domestic public debt during 2022, and reflecting the high cost of public borrowing, interest payments have increased and are projected at 2.5 percent of GDP in 2023 (compared to 2.1 percent in 2022). Revenue increased by 27 percent in 2023Q3 compared to 2022Q4 reflecting higher income tax receipts and non-tax measures (Text Table 1).”",

To rectify the wage bill overrun following the implementation of the Tabela Salarial Única – TSU (single wage bill table) that started in October 2022, the government has undertaken several measures including the revision of the wage bill law to deliver on fiscal objectives as articulated in the 2023 National Budget. Specific measures undertaken by the government include: i) the reduction in the nominal wage levels relative to the original TSU framework; ii) freezing new hires in the special sectors; iii) canceling the 13th paycheck; iv) introducing the payroll of the special sectors into the system; and v) audit of all civil servants including from the special sectors to eliminate irregularities, including potential ghost workers. Going forward, monitoring instruments, including monthly wage bill reporting, regular audits and proof of life will be adopted to avoid wage bill slippages. Reflecting these remedial measures, the authorities seek to reduce the wage bill from 16.4 percent to 14.6 percent of GDP by the end-2023. Meanwhile, the authorities are implementing additional measures to bring the wage bill to around 10 percent of GDP over the medium-term, consistent with the program objectives.",

However, given the dependence of public finances on oil revenue, a significant part of the revenue gains was due to factors unrelated to fiscal consolidation, such as oil/petroleum price increases, as the report notes on the same page: “The Federal Government’s budget for 1995 aimed at reducing the overall fiscal deficit by more than 6 percentage points, to 2.5 percent of GDP. This ambitious fiscal adjustment was predicated on a more than doubling of federal government revenue and strict control over expenditure. The increase in the domestic transfer price of crude oil, from US$8 per barrel to US$17 per barrel (at the official exchange rate), and the profits deriving from the October 1994 increase in the domestic retail price of petroleum products were to account for the bulk of the projected revenue gains.”. Page 15 of the same report further confirms that the improved fiscal health was due to higher commodity prices: “There are worrying signs, though, that these recent improvements in fiscal performance may not be sustained in the period ahead. First, the resources of the Petroleum Trust Fund are slated to be spent, which will result in an immediate deterioration in the Federal Government's overall fiscal position. Second, pressures are building up to accelerate the capital expenditure program and accommodate current expenditure overruns. Third, the distribution of the intervention profits of the Central Bank, with a view inter alia to alleviating the state governments' finances, would add to the already potentially sizable fiscal impulse. In the staff's view, it is essential for the authorities to adhere strictly to the original fiscal stance, as announced in the 1995 budget, and to remain prepared to take additional corrective steps if the rate of inflation is not brought under control. As a minimum, prospective spending by the Petroleum Trust Fund will need to be scaled down considerably, the revenue shortfall during the first half of 1995 must be made up, and expenditure cuts will be necessary to offset earlier overruns in personnel and overhead costs.”",

Page 13 also notes: “The fiscal consolidation contained in the proposed 2011 budget and medium term expenditure framework is welcome.

Page 14 states “Continued inflationary pressures and the steady decline in international reserves call for a tightening of monetary policy. The recent increases in policy rates by the CBN are welcome, but additional increases will likely be needed if fiscal consolidation is not sufficient or timely.” Page 2 of the Executive Board Assessment also states that “Directors supported the authorities’ planned fiscal consolidation to rebuild fiscal space and contain price pressures.

Page 16 adds: “Given limited buffers, the draft budget appropriately tightens the fiscal stance. Relative to 2014, staff projects that oil revenue will drop by 2.4 percentage points of GDP. The MTEF envisages a gradual increase in non-oil revenues (0.1 percent of GDP in 2015), with a reduction in expenditure of 1.7 percent of GDP (1 percent from lower fuel subsidies, 0.2 from lower capital spending, and 0.5 from adjustment by SLGs). The projected overall impact is an increase of 0.3 percentage points of GDP in the consolidated government deficit. However, fiscal buffers remain weak and, absent additional fiscal adjustments, staff projects that the ECA could be depleted by end-2015 (SIP: Oil Sector Developments). In addition, with FG capital spending envisaged at 0.4 percent of GDP, the ability to delay capital spending as an informal buffer, as has happened in previous years, is limited. Staff welcomes the announced steps to increase revenue through enhanced revenue administration and excise taxes and fees on luxury goods and services. Nevertheless, staff sees the need to identify additional contingency measures to contain recurrent expenditures and boost non-oil revenues in 2015—such as accelerating potential reforms to VAT and CIT (20)—to prevent the ECA from being fully depleted.”",

In 1995, total expenditure will only increase by about 2 percent, to reach CFAF 434.9 billion. To keep the wage bill within the originally programmed ceiling of CFAF 160 billion, the adopted budget foresees no general wage increase in 1995. No such increase will be granted and recruitment will be strictly limited, giving priority to the health and education sectors. Moreover, the costs of regularizing the verified rappels (corresponding to the financial impact of promotions for which payment orders have not yet been issued) will be included within the above-mentioned wage bill. The increase in the wage bill in 1995 should, therefore, be held to about 6 percent, reflecting the full-year impact of the 10 percent pay raise of last April, normal promotions, and the limited recruitment. The civil service audit will be initiated in April 1995 and the recommended measures will be put in place beginning in July 1995. Expenditure planned in the context of the social safety net (CFAF 10 billion) will be maintained, but will be integrated within the Government's social programs, and social spending will be targeted more effectively, in line with the recommendations of a recent IMF technical assistance mission. Any additional expenditure made necessary by the recent change in the Government will be compensated by reductions in other areas. The deficit of the special accounts will be substantially reduced by taking the measures required to balance the operations of the National Retirement Fund (FNR) from June 1995. The program for 1995 foresees that capital expenditure will amount to CFAF 116 billion, with priority given to infrastructure and high-return projects in the productive sectors. The necessary instructions have been given to ensure that no extrabudgetary expenditures are made, and this will be respected by all ministries. Before end-September 1995, a study on the expenditure system, as well as on the procedure for commitment and payment, will be completed, and the necessary measures will be implemented in the context of the 1996 budget.”",

Higher tax revenue and tight aggregate expenditure control strengthened public finances, with the basic fiscal balance reaching a surplus of 2.2 percent of GDP in 2002, compared with projections of 1.3 percent and a deficit of 0.8 percent in 2001 (Table 6). The 10 percent increase in tax revenue (to 17.7 percent of GDP) reflected the unification of VAT rates in September 2001 and strong collection efforts in the second half of 2002, which, however, did not suffice to achieve the indicative revenue target of 18.1 percent of GDP. In light of the uncertain tax revenue performance, total expenditure and net lending were contained below the target level at 20.2 percent of GDP, down from 21.7 percent in 2001. The targeted sharp cutback in subsidies was only partially offset by strong growth in capital expenditure. Uncertainty about the timing of total HIPC debt relief, initially projected for 2002, also led the authorities to postpone related spending to 2003, yielding savings of 0.6 percent of GDP in 2002 relative to projections. The resulting unused HIPC resources were accumulated in a special account at the central bank. As a result, overall government operations, including grants, moved to a surplus of 0.4 percent GDP in 2002, from a deficit of 2 percent in 2001, and the government reduced its domestic debt.”",

The new fiscal deficit target for 2013 (5.3 percent of GDP, against an initial target of 4.9 percent) would accommodate the impact of exogenous shocks. However, it would still entail a significant reduction of the deficit and require substantial efforts in light of other pressures on the budget, particularly those stemming from the energy sector. The authorities expect the revenue base to be shored up by a number of new measures. These include a new tax on cosmetic products, an increase in the tax on tobacco, the inclusion in the VAT base of certain telecommunication activities, the end of the exemption from VAT of certain activities financed by external resources, and an advanced payment on the income tax made at the importation stage (which should allow bringing more small and medium businesses into the tax net). The authorities estimate that all these measures will generate at least 0.4 percent of GDP in revenue. In addition, the partial elimination of VAT withholding should improve the collection of this tax. On the expenditure side, investment financed on external concessional resources has been revised downward significantly in light of delays in mobilizing the financing; however, such investment is still expected to increase in nominal terms from 2012. Interest payments are also expected to be lower than programmed, thanks in part to lower interest rates. The cabinet approved in May 2013 a supplementary budget for 2013 reflecting these changes.”",

A revenue shortfall amounting to about 0.5 percent of GDP was incurred in the first half of the year, mostly in the first quarter. It was driven by a number of factors, such as a more-generous-than-expected reduction of the personal income tax, transitory VAT collection shortfalls reflecting the phasing out of VAT withholding by government agencies, and disappointing nontax revenue. In addition, the power sector’s tight financial situation continued to weigh on revenue collection. Revenue collection is expected to improve in the second half of 2013, but not enough to prevent a significant shortfall at year end. The authorities intend to meet the deficit target, however, thanks to savings on the wage bill, interest payments, and the deferral of a few budgeted investment projects.”",

Securing the revenue base is an important objective for the authorities; recurrent revenue shortfalls have indeed complicated fiscal management and required inefficient expenditure cuts in the course of the past few years. The immediate priority is to complete the major tax reform launched in 2013, with in particular the introduction of cash refunds for VAT credits and the completion of all implementing regulations. After this major reform, the tax system needs to be stabilized, which warrants a focus on complementary tax administration reforms. They include changes to the remuneration of tax inspectors to ensure adequate incentives to broaden the tax base rather than a focus on a few large taxpayers, and increased staffing, which is required for a resolution of existing tax arrears, a comprehensive audit of VAT credits, and more intensive use of various sources of information. These measures, together with a few specific tax policy measures, should increase the tax revenue ratio by 0.3 percent of GDP in 2014. An indicative revenue target has also been introduced in the program, and the authorities are committed to taking early corrective measures should a shortfall be expected again at the time of the 7th review.",

This streamlining—a decrease in the current expenditure ratio of 0.8 percentage point of GDP—will contribute to the reduction of the deficit while allowing for an increase in the investment ratio and for the development of key components of the social safety net, such as the Family Security Allowance (a conditional cash transfer) and progress towards universal health coverage. A focus on eliminating unproductive expenditures and raising investment should ensure more efficient and growth-friendly government spending. The streamlining will affect many expenditure areas, including the government’s utility bills, the wage bill (with a focus on wage moderation to offset the impact of new hiring), and a number of transfers (e.g., agriculture). In higher education, politically difficult decisions have been taken to improve the targeting of scholarships and increase tuitions. While the restructuring of public agencies will likely produce savings in the medium term, it may generate costs in the short term related to the termination of certain contracts and the reallocation of a number of employees. Overall, the deficit target is somewhat higher than projected at the time of the previous review (by 0.2 percent of GDP, at 4.9 percent), to accommodate additional public investment and possible costs from agency restructuring.”",

The authorities’ fiscal consolidation plans envisage a primary deficit approaching zero in 2021, with the consolidated budget deficit declining from 4.3 percent in 2018 to 3.5 percent in 2021. After taking into account the reprioritization of spending, the overall expenditure ceiling has been revised downward by R5.8 billion or 0.1 percent of GDP. In addition, 0.7 percent of GDP in new revenue measures in 2018/19 have been implemented. The measures include an increase in the VAT rate, limiting personal income tax bracket adjustments for inflation, and an increase in the fuel levy and excise duties. Under the baseline growth scenario, these actions should ensure that non-interest government spending remains within the ceiling, currently translating to 26.6 percent of GDP. This will help stabilize the debt ratio at around 56.2 percent of GDP in 2022/23.”",

The revenue measures, which took effect on July 1, 1994, include extending the sales taxes to a wide range of services, levying an import duty of 10 percent on imported crude oil, introducing a withholding tax on interest income from treasury bills, raising road tolls and a majority of fees and charges, and increasing the maximum tariff rate from 40 percent to 50 percent. Combined, these new measures are expected to yield additional revenue of T Sh 37 billion in 1994/95, or 2.8 percent of GDP. As indicated in paragraph 16 of the attached memorandum, the Government also took firm action in the budget to strengthen customs administration, with the enforcement of strict control especially over bonded warehouses and transit trade to prevent import duty evasion and revenue leakage. The introduction of a taxpayer identification number system in 1994/95 will provide the tax authorities with critical information for identifying unregistered potential taxpayers, taxpayers who fail to file tax returns, tax evaders, and delinquent taxpayers, which should therefore strengthen revenue collections through improved tax compliance. The Government will take preparatory steps in 1994/95, with the help of the new fiscal advisor provided under Fund technical assistance, toward the introduction of the value-added tax (VAT) by January 1996.",

These reductions again led to a major loss of revenues, with the fiscal position weakened further in the opening months of the fiscal year by the high cost of the first multiparty elections in Tanzania. In this situation, the new government that took office in November 1995 introduced several revenue-enhancing measures, and also undertook a substantial cut in recurrent expenditure, focused on low priority areas. Furthermore, stringent cash management of the budget was applied, utilizing the recently strengthened expenditure control procedures. These measures formed the basis of a Fund staff-monitored program under which the fiscal performance improved markedly in the second half of the fiscal year. With a deceleration in the rate of broad money growth, stemming importantly from an improved fiscal performance in the second half of 1995/96, inflation had declined on a year-end basis to 18.0 percent by August 1996, from a peak of 38 percent for the year ended February 1995, and an annual average of almost 30 percent in 1992/93-1994/95.”",

Expenditure on goods, services, and transfers increased sharply, as had been expected; this was due to greater realism in the initial budget allocation (in particular for utilities and feeding programs that had been susceptible to the accumulation of arrears), as well as better budget execution (especially in the second half of the fiscal year, when priority sectors started receiving quarterly allocations instead of the monthly releases under the cash budget system). The emergence of new expenditure arrears has been avoided since end-2000, and existing arrears were paid down in part. Recurrent expenditure on priority sectors increased from the equivalent of 4.1 percent of GDP in 1999/2000 to 4.6 percent in 2000/01 (Table 7).”",

    "quote": "However, the EBS/95/173 report provides evidence that the fiscal consolidation measure was motivated by cyclical conditions. As noted on page 4, the adjustment was undertaken in response to a coffee price boom, which generated a temporary windfall for the economy: “Following a modest rebound in the price of coffee in 1993/94, Uganda was faced with a major coffee boom in 1994/95, consequent upon the host damage in Brazil, and the resultant surge in export prices. The average price for Ugandan coffee increased by over 120 percent from US\\$1.14 per kg in 1993/94 to US\\$2.52 in 1994/95, yielding a windfall to the economy equivalent to about 3.7 percent of GDP…The Government’s response was prudent and appropriate. Early in 1994/95, the Government began to pursue a policy of sterilizing part of the inflows in order to contain an appreciation in the real effective exchange rate. This involved monetary absorption through the increased sales of treasury bills and the introduction of a windfall tax on coffee exports. In addition, a strong fiscal adjustment was pursued, focused on expenditure restraint, and negative bank financing. The result was that monetary growth impulses arising from the buildup in international reserves were significantly less than would otherwise have been the case.  This, together with a significant real output response, significantly higher imports, and a rise in private sector savings, enabled Uganda to manage the boom with a broadly stable nominal exchange rate and low inflation. External competitiveness was maintained, and there was continued strong progress in diversification of the export base.”",

Revenues are expected to increase by 1.1 percentage points, to 11.6 percent of GDP. Besides the continued improvement in tax administration, measures introduced in the 1995/96 budget include: (i) withdrawing the remission of duties on raw materials; (ii) harmonizing the lower sales tax rates with the Commercial Transactions Levy rate of 15 percent (which will also facilitate the introduction of the VAT); (iii) increasing some charges for licenses and fees; (iv) closing duty-free shops; and (v) improving customs collections and efficiency for the clearing of cargo, by ending the monopoly of the parastatal handling cargo and introducing competition for these services, as well as for pre- and post-import inspection services. In downward trend in coffee prices, the rate of the coffee stabilization tax was reduced to 25 percent (from 32 percent) and the. threshold raised to U Sh 1,500 per kg (from U Sh 1,100 per kg). The budget also announced a major shift in the policy on granting discretionary tax and duty exemptions, designed to boost revenue buoyancy as well as increase transparency and accountability. These measures are discussed in paragraph 9 of the memorandum on economic and financial policies (Appendix I) and in Annex I.”",

The IMF Staff Country Report No. 98/61 details this issue on page 4: “A value-added tax (VAT) with a single positive rate of 17 percent was introduced on July 1, 1996 in Uganda     after two years of preparation with assistance from the Fund. It replaced a sales tax on goods and selected services at rates between 12 percent and 30 percent. Several problems began to affect the operations of the VAT soon after its introduction. First, the number of potential VAT taxpayers was much larger than planned; second, resistance to the new tax from traders escalated into a strike in late September to early October 1996. Third, the computer system installed for the tax was not adaptable enough to provide information required for its management. Finally, the response of the authorities to the strike and the priorities of VAT administrators after the strike exacerbated compliance under the tax during the first year of its operation. As a result, compliance was poor during the first few months following the introduction of the tax and remained below expectations during the first year of its operation.”",
