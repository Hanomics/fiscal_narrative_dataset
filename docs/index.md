# Fiscal Consolidation Narrative Shocks (SSA)

Welcome to the documentation site for the **Fiscal Consolidation Narrative Shocks** dataset for Sub‑Saharan Africa.  This site provides an overview of the dataset, explains the methodology, lists the variables, and describes the country coverage.

## Overview

This dataset records annual narrative fiscal consolidation episodes for a set of Sub‑Saharan African countries.  Each episode represents a policy action—either tax increases or spending cuts—identified through historical narratives (e.g. government budgets, policy statements) rather than mechanical budget accounting.  The aim is to provide a clean measure of discretionary fiscal consolidation efforts for macroeconomic research.

## Country coverage

The initial release covers 14 countries from 1990 onwards.  The table below summarises the coverage for each country.  For each country we list the first and last years of coverage and the number of consolidation episodes (years with non‑zero `tax` or `spend`).

<!-- The table below will be programmatically generated by the build_docs script. -->
