# Current Data

This folder mirrors the latest data release for convenience.  The files here are identical to those in the most recent `data/versions/` subdirectory.

## Files

* `narrative_shocks.csv` – the latest dataset in comma‑separated format.
* `narrative_shocks.dta` – the latest dataset in Stata format.
* `narrative_shocks.xlsx` – the original Excel file for the latest release.

If you are developing code or analysis, we recommend referencing the versioned files in `data/versions/` to ensure reproducibility.  The `current/` folder may change with each new release.
