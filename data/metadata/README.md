# Data Metadata

The `metadata/` directory contains auxiliary documentation describing the dataset:

* `variables.md` – a table describing each variable in the dataset.
* `country_summaries/` (generated programmatically) – one‑page summaries for each country, including the years covered, the number of consolidation episodes, and basic statistics.

These metadata files are intended to help users understand and interpret the dataset.  They complement the machine‑readable schema in `data/schema/dataset_schema.json`.
